4. Write a shell script that, given a file name as theargument, will write the even-numbered line to a file with the name evenfile and odd-numbered lines to a file called oddfile.
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
echo "No file name provided as argument."
exit 1
fi
Check if the file exists

if [ ! -f $1 ]; then
echo "File not found."
exit 1
fi
Initialize line counter

count=1
Loop through the file

while read line; do
# Determine if line is even or odd
if [ $((count%2)) -eq 0 ]; then
# Write even line to evenfile
echo $line >> evenfile
else
# Write odd line to oddfile
echo $line >> oddfile
fi
# Increment line counter
count=$((count+1))
done < $1

echo "Lines written to oddfile and evenfile successfully."
