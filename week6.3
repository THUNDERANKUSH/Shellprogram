3. Write the shell script to replace each character ‘c’ occurrence with the characters in ‘a’ string s. It should also display the number of replacements.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a string:"
read string

count=$(echo "$string" | grep -o "c" | wc -l)
new_string=$(echo "$string" | tr 'c' 'a')

echo "Original string: $string"
echo "New string:      $new_string"
echo "Replacements:    $count"
